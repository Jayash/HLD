# Reliable, Scalable and Maintainable Application

non-functional requirements for any application

## Reliability
The system should continue to work correctly even in the face of adversity (hardware or software faults and human error)
- Hardware faults
- Software faults
- Human Errors

## Scalability
As the system grows there should be reasonable ways of dealing with the growth
- Calculate Load: How much load an application has to handle
- Calculate Performance: how performant must be the application
- Approaches for coping with load

## Maintainability:
Over time, many different people will work on the system, and they should all be able to work on it productively
- Operability: Make it easy for operations team to keep the system running smoothly
- Simplicity: Managing Complexity
- Evolvability: Making change easy
